# hearMD
*Like House MD, but we actually listen. And without the Vicodin problem.*

hearMD is an AI-powered OPD assistant that eavesdrops on doctor-patient conversations (with consent, we're not *that* cool) and magically transforms them into clean clinical notes and prescriptions. So doctors can actually look at patients instead of their keyboards.

**White label B2B SaaS.** The name "hearMD" is just our GitHub swag. When deployed, it wears your clinic's name like a custom tux.

## What hearMD Actually Does

Doctors talk. Patients talk. hearMD sits in the corner like a really productive wallflower and handles the boring paperwork nobody wanted to do anyway.

### Core Features (The Good Stuff)

- **Listens to OPD consultations** – real-time or recordings, we're flexible like that
- **Converts rambling conversations into structured notes** – yes, even when Uncle Ramesh goes off on a tangent about his knee pain from 1987
- **Extracts complaints, history, and observations** – like a very organized detective
- **Helps doctors build prescriptions** with search and formatting – because Comic Sans has no place in medicine
- **Generates clean visit summaries and PDFs** – printable, shareable, frameable (okay maybe not that last one)
- **Keeps the doctor fully in control** – at all times, no exceptions

**No diagnosis. No auto-medication suggestions. No scary robot overlord vibes.**

Just vibes and help.

## What hearMD is NOT

Listen, we need to be clear here:

- Not a decision-making medical AI (doctors went to med school for a reason)
- Not a generic transcription app (we have *standards*)
- Not replacing doctors (we can't pull off the white coat)
- Not giving medical advice (that's illegal and also rude)

**hearMD assists. Doctors decide. End of story.**

## Why This Even Exists

Real talk: Doctors shouldn't be hunched over keyboards while patients are literally sitting right there. OPDs are noisy, chaotic, and mentally exhausting. Documentation is the worst part of everyone's day.

hearMD exists to:

- Reduce typing (carpal tunnel is not a personality trait)
- Reduce burnout (doctors are humans too, shocking we know)
- Speed up OPD flow (more patients helped, less keyboard warrioring)
- Make notes cleaner and more consistent (future you will thank present you)

---

## Who This Is For

- **Clinic owners** who are tired of the paperwork chaos
- **OPD doctors** who miss eye contact with patients
- **Small to mid-size hospitals** trying to do more with less

This is **B2B SaaS**, not a consumer app. We're enterprise, baby. Sort of.

## White Label First (Identity Crisis Included)

hearMD is built to completely rebrand itself like a chameleon with commitment issues:

- Custom clinic name
- Custom logo
- Custom doctor details
- Zero hearMD branding in patient outputs

**Patients never see hearMD. They only see their clinic.** We're basically the ghost writer of medical documentation.

## MVP Scope (Starting Small, Dreaming Big)

- Audio capture
- Speech-to-text
- Structured OPD notes
- Manual prescription builder
- PDF export

Plenty more planned. But Rome wasn't debugged in a day.

---

## Tech Philosophy (Our Vibe)

- **Assist, not automate** – we're the sidekick, not the hero
- **Speed over complexity** – because ain't nobody got time for that
- **Trust over hype** – we promise to never use the phrase "AI-powered revolution"
- **Doctor workflow stays untouched** – if it needs a manual, we failed

**If a doctor needs training to use it, we screwed up.**

## Status

Early-stage build. Actively iterating. Very open to feedback. Fueled by caffeine and the belief that paperwork shouldn't be this painful.

---

## Fun Fact

House MD never actually listened to his patients. He just had really good hunches and a team that did all the work.

We listen. And we don't insult anyone. *Much.*

*Built with love and the firm belief that doctors deserve better tools and patients deserve better attention.*
